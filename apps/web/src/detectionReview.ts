/**
 * Scoring the shipped detection rules against the incident just worked.
 *
 * This is the one thing a generated corpus can do that a captured one
 * cannot. Because the generator planted every malicious event, a rule's true
 * positives, false positives and false negatives are computable rather than
 * estimated -- so "how good is this detection" has an exact answer here and
 * only an argument anywhere else.
 *
 * It is deliberately not available during the investigation. The labels are
 * the answer: a panel showing which events are malicious would end the
 * exercise the moment it was opened. It runs after finalizing, against the
 * same telemetry the analyst just worked by hand, which is what makes the
 * comparison worth anything -- the interesting column is the one where the
 * rules missed something the analyst found.
